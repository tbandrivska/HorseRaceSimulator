## üì¶ Project Overview

This project simulates a horse race in two parts:

- **Part 1: Text-Based Simulator**
    - Terminal-based horse race for 3 horses
    - Each horse has a name, symbol, confidence, distance, and fall chance
    - Implements object-oriented design, encapsulation, and race logic

- **Part 2: GUI with Customisable Horses**
    - JavaFX interface for race customisation
    - Users can select:
        - Horse breed
        - Coat colour
        - Symbol (unicode/emoji)
        - Equipment (saddle, horseshoes, accessories)
    - Attributes like breed and equipment affect confidence and performance
