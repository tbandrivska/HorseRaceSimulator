# Horse Race Simulator 
 By SID:240610148
Welcome to the Horse Race Simulator - a dynamic JavaFX application where you can create custom horses, place bets, and watch them race. 
 ## Known Limitations
 - Winner is currently random (can be extended using horse stats)

  - No persistent storage (wallet resets on restart)

   - Betting history not saved beyond session

## Features

### Customisable Horses
- Select **breed**, **coat colour**, and **equipment** (saddle, horseshoes, accessories)
- Pick a **unique symbol or emoji** to represent each horse
- Customisation influences horse confidence (affecting performance)

### Betting System
- Start with a wallet of **Â£100**
- Choose a horse to bet on and enter a wager
- Win or lose based on the race result
- Wallet updates after each race
- Betting summary displayed after every match

### Animated Races
- Horses race across the screen using JavaFX `TranslateTransition`
- Winner chosen randomly (can be expanded to stat-based)
- Visual representation of the race in motion

### Stats & Feedback
- Dynamic **betting stats panel**
- **Wallet tracker**
- Visual race output
- Emoji-based feedback (for fun and clarity)

### UX Enhancements
- **ScrollPane** wraps full window: scrolls smoothly when window overflows
- **Race track** has its own scroll zone (if lots of horses)
- Maximum of **6 horses** to ensure clean UI and readable display
